# 1.1. Inheritance and polymosphism (Level 2 - Exercise 1)

## Project Description üìÑ

This project is a Java implementation that solves the following exercise:

"Create a class called "Phone" with the make and model attributes, and the call() method. This method should receive a String with a phone number. The method should display a console message saying that the number received by parameter is being called. 

Create an interface called "Camera" with the takePhoto() method, and another interface called Clock with the alarm() method.

Create a class named "Smartphone" that follows a subclass of "Phone" and then implements the "Camera" and "Clock" interfaces.

The takePhoto() method must display on the console: ‚ÄúA photo is being taken‚Äù and the alarm() method must display: ‚ÄúThe alarm is ringing‚Äù." 

This exercise focuses on object-oriented principles such as inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.
